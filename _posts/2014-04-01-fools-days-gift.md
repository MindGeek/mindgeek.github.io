今天是愚人节，开始我的Blog之路吧：）

之前曾经零散的在BlogBus、点点等地方写过一些东西。现在去看，大多稚嫩得很，自己都不大忍心读完。但是其中也不乏一些当时的真情实感，看后令人唏嘘。

坚持写下我的生活和思想吧，证明自己曾经活过。

Today is Fool's Day. I deside to continue my bloger life in Github.

I have been writing some articals in BlogBus or DianDian. From today's perspective, most of them are tender and immature. But there are still some of them which truly reflect the circumstance and thought of myself. They are greate reminder of how I perceived the world back then. They tell me I have been there.

So Mg, Please try to write something constantly, to prove the existence of your life.
